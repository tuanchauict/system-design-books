# Learn System Design in a Hurry

While conducting thousands of mock system design interviews with Hello Interview, we frequently work with candidates who have an upcoming interview in a few days or even tomorrow. Let's be real: no one is going to become a system design master overnight. Instead, what we've put together is 'System Design in a Hurry' - using data from hundreds of mock interview sessions across companies and interviewers, we've identified the most common flags and outlined the content to help you eliminate them. Wherever possible, we link to in-depth information should you wish to learn more.

The intent here is to cover the last and most impactful 20%, not to teach you from scratch. While 'System Design in a Hurry' won't build mastery, it's still high-leverage. The key concepts we cover are relevant for system design in the real world - and interviewers generally will try to align their interviews with these concepts because they're practical, not strictly academic.

Other system design materials are either ChatGPT spew or go to a level of depth that you'll never possibly cover in an interview (and might be a yellow flag if you do). We aimed to make 'System Design in a Hurry' dense, practical, and efficient. Moreover, it's 100% free forever. While we could charge for this material we think it's far more important to level the playing field of system design interviews.

If you want to support us, we have supplementary content available via our [**premium**](https://www.hellointerview.com/premium) offering and our [**expert interviewers are available for mock interviews**](https://www.hellointerview.com/mock/schedule) and can pinpoint the primary areas for you to focus much better than any guide can!
